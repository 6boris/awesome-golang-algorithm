# 0160.Intersection-of-Two-Linked-Lists

## Description

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

![case 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_statement.png)

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Example 1:**

![Example 1:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_1.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

![Example 2:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_2.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

![Example 3:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/13/160_example_3.png)

```text
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

## 题意

> 给定两个链表，请找它们的交汇点。

* 如果两个链表不相交，则返回 null；
* 在函数结束时，两个链表必须保持原来的结构；
* 链表中不存在环；
* 你的代码需要的时间复杂度是 O\(n\)O\(n\)，额外的空间复杂度是 O\(1\)O\(1\)；
