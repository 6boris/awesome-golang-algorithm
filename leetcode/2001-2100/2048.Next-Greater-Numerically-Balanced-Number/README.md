# [2048.Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number][title]

## Description
An integer `x` is **numerically balanced** if for every digit `d` in the number `x`, there are **exactly** `d` occurrences of that digit in `x`.

Given an integer `n`, return the **smallest numerically balanced** number **strictly greater** than `n`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 22
Explanation: 
22 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 2 occurs 2 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1000
Output: 1333
Explanation: 
1333 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1000.
Note that 1022 cannot be the answer because 0 appeared more than 0 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3000
Output: 3133
Explanation: 
3133 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times.
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 3000.
```
