# [2054.Two Best Non-Overlapping Events][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array of `events` where `events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startTimei` and ends at `endTimei`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You can choose **at most two non-overlapping** events to attend such that the sum of their values is **maximized**.

Return this **maximum** sum.

Note that the start time and end time is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time `t`, the next event must start at or after `t + 1`.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./1.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[2,4,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 for a sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./2.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a sum of 5.
```

**Example 3:**  

![3](./3.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,5,3],[1,5,1],[6,6,5]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Choose events 0 and 2 for a sum of 3 + 5 = 8.
```
