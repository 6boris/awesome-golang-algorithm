# [2032.Two Out of Three][title]

## Description
Given three integer arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, return a **distinct** array containing all the values that are present in **at least two** out of the three arrays. You may return the values in `any` order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,1,3,2], nums2 = [2,3], nums3 = [3]
Output: [3,2]
Explanation: The values that are present in at least two arrays are:
- 3, in all three arrays.
- 2, in nums1 and nums2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [3,1], nums2 = [2,3], nums3 = [1,2]
Output: [2,3,1]
Explanation: The values that are present in at least two arrays are:
- 2, in nums2 and nums3.
- 3, in nums1 and nums2.
- 1, in nums1 and nums3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2], nums2 = [4,3,3], nums3 = [5]
Output: []
Explanation: No value is present in at least two arrays.
```
