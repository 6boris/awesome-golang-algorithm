# [2070.Most Beautiful Item for Each Query][title]

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `items` where `items[i] = [pricei, beautyi]` denotes the **price** and **beauty** of an item respectively.

You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `queries`. For each `queries[j]`, you want to determine the **maximum beauty** of an item whose **price** is **less than or equal** to `queries[j]`. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is `0`.

Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries` where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `jth` query.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]
Explanation:
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. 
  The maximum beauty among them is 4.
- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].
  The maximum beauty among them is 5.
- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.
  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]
Output: [4]
Explanation: 
The price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4. 
Note that multiple items can have the same price and/or beauty.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: items = [[10,1000]], queries = [5]
Output: [0]
Explanation:
No item has a price less than or equal to 5, so no item can be chosen.
Hence, the answer to the query is 0.
```
