# [2091.Removing Minimum and Maximum From Array][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** array of **distinct** integers `nums`.

There is an element in `nums` that has the **lowest** value and an element that has the **highest** value. We call them the **minimum** and **maximum** respectively. Your goal is to remove **both** these elements from the array.

A **deletion** is defined as either removing an element from the **front** of the array or removing an element from the **back** of the array.

Return the **minimum** number of deletions it would take to remove **both** the minimum and maximum element from the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,10,7,5,4,1,8,6]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[5], which is 1.
The maximum element in the array is nums[1], which is 10.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 2 elements from the front and 3 elements from the back.
This results in 2 + 3 = 5 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,-4,19,1,8,-2,-3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The minimum element in the array is nums[1], which is -4.
The maximum element in the array is nums[2], which is 19.
We can remove both the minimum and maximum by removing 3 elements from the front.
This results in only 3 deletions, which is the minimum number possible.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [101]
Output: 1
Explanation:  
There is only one element in the array, which makes it both the minimum and maximum element.
We can remove it with 1 deletion.
```
