# [2044.Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, find the **maximum** possible **bitwise OR** of a subset of `nums` and return the **number of different non-empty subsets** with the maximum bitwise OR.

An array `a` is a **subset** of an array `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of `b`. Two subsets are considered **different** if the indices of the elements chosen are different.

The bitwise OR of an array `a` is equal to `a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1]` (**0-indexed**).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 3. There are 2 subsets with a bitwise OR of 3:
- [3]
- [3,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: All non-empty subsets of [2,2,2] have a bitwise OR of 2. There are 23 - 1 = 7 total subsets.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 7. There are 6 subsets with a bitwise OR of 7:
- [3,5]
- [3,1,5]
- [3,2,5]
- [3,2,1,5]
- [2,5]
- [2,1,5]
```
