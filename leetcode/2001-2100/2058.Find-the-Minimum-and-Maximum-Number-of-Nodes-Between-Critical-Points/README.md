# [2058.Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points][title]

## Description
A **critical point** in a linked list is defined as **either** a **local maxima** or a **local minima**.

A node is a **local maxima** if the current node has a value **strictly greater** than the previous node and the next node.

A node is a **local minima** if the current node has a value **strictly smaller** than the previous node and the next node.

Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists **both** a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return an array of length 2 containing [`minDistance`, `maxDistance`] where `minDistance` is the **minimum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points and `maxDistance` is the **maximum distance** between **any two distinct** critical points. If there are **fewer** than two critical points, return [`-1, -1`].

**Example 1:**  

![1](./a1.png)

```
Input: head = [3,1]
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There are no critical points in [3,1].
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./a2.png)

```
Input: head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: There are three critical points:
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]: The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node. minDistance = 6 - 5 = 1.
The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node. maxDistance = 6 - 3 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**  

![3](./a5.png)

```
Input: head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]
Output: [3,3]
Explanation: There are two critical points:
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]: The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node.
Thus, minDistance and maxDistance is 5 - 2 = 3.
Note that the last node is not considered a local maxima because it does not have a next node.
```
