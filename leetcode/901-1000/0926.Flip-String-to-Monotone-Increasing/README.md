# [926.Flip String to Monotone Increasing][title]

## Description
A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `0`'s (possibly none), followed by some number of `1`'s (also possibly none).

You are given a binary string `s`. You can flip `s[i]` changing it from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.

Return the minimum number of flips to make `s` monotone increasing.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "00011000"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
```
