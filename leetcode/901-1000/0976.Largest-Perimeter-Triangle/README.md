# [976.Largest Perimeter Triangle][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.
```
