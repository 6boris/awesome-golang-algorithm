# [934.Shortest Bridge][title]

## Description
You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water.

An **island** is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`'s not connected to any other `1`'s. There are **exactly two islands** in `grid`.

You may change `0`'s to `1`'s to connect the two islands to form **one island**.

Return the smallest number of `0`'s you must flip to connect the two islands.

 
**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 1
```
