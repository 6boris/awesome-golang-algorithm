# [960.Delete Columns to Make Sorted III][title]

## Description
You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `["bef", "vyz"]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices answer such that after deletions, the final array has **every string (row) in lexicographic** order. (i.e., `(strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] <= ... <= strs[0][strs[0].length - 1])`, and `(strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1] <= ... <= strs[1][strs[1].length - 1])`, and so on). Return the minimum possible value of `answer.length`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["babca","bbazb"]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is strs = ["bc", "az"].
Both these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0][0] <= strs[0][1] and strs[1][0] <= strs[1][1]).
Note that strs[0] > strs[1] - the array strs is not necessarily in lexicographic order.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["edcba"]
Output: 4
Explanation: If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row will not be lexicographically sorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: strs = ["ghi","def","abc"]
Output: 0
Explanation: All rows are already lexicographically sorted.
```
