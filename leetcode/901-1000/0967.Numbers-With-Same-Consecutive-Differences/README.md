# [967.Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences][title]

## Description
Return all **non-negative** integers of length `n` such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is `k`.

Note that **every** number in the answer **must not** have leading zeros. For example, `01` has one leading zero and is invalid.

You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 7
Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]
```
