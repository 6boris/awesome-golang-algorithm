# [990.Satisfiability of Equality Equations][title]

## Description
You are given an array of strings `equations` that represent relationships between variables where each string `equations[i]` is of length `4` and takes one of two different forms: `"xi==yi"` or `"xi!=yi"`.Here, `xi` and `yi` are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return `true` if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```
