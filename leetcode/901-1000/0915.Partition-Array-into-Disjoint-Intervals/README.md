# [915.Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals][title]


## Description
Given an array `nums`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:

 - Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
 - `left` and `right` are non-empty.
 - `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the `length` of `left` after such a partitioning. It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
```
