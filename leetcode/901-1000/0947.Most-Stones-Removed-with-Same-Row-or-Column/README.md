# [947.Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column][title]

## Description
On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either **the same row or the same column** as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length n where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of the i<sup>th</sup> stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: [0,0] is the o
```
