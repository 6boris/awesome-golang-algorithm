# [1743.Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs][title]

## Description
There is an integer array `nums` that consists of `n` **unique** elements, but you have forgotten it. However, you do remember every pair of adjacent elements in `nums`.

You are given a 2D integer array `adjacentPairs` of size `n - 1` where each `adjacentPairs[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that the elements u<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>i</sub> are adjacent in `nums`.

It is guaranteed that every adjacent pair of elements `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` will exist in `adjacentPairs`, either as `[nums[i], nums[i+1]]` or `[nums[i+1], nums[i]]`. The pairs can appear in **any order**.

Return the original array `nums`. If there are multiple solutions, return **any of them**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: adjacentPairs = [[2,1],[3,4],[3,2]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: This array has all its adjacent pairs in adjacentPairs.
Notice that adjacentPairs[i] may not be in left-to-right order.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: adjacentPairs = [[4,-2],[1,4],[-3,1]]
Output: [-2,4,1,-3]
Explanation: There can be negative numbers.
Another solution is [-3,1,4,-2], which would also be accepted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: adjacentPairs = [[100000,-100000]]
Output: [100000,-100000]
```
