# [1791.Find Center of Star Graph][title]

## Description
There is an undirected **star** graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one **center** node and **exactly** `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`. Return the center of the given star graph.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./star_graph.png)

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: 1
```
