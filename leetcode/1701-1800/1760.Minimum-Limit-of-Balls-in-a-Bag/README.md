# [1760.Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` where the `ith` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a **positive** number of balls.

    - For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.

Your penalty is the **maximum** number of balls in a bag. You want to **minimize** your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2, and you should return 2.
```
