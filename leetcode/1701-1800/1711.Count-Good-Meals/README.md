# [1711.Count Good Meals][title]

## Description
A **good meal** is a meal that contains **exactly two different food items** with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick **any** two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the `ith` item of food, return the number of different **good meals** you can make from this list modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.
```
