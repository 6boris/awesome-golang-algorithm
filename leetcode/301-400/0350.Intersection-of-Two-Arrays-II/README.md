# [350.Intersection of Two Arrays II][title]

## Description
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
