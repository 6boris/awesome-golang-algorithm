# [341.Flatten Nested List Iterator][title]

## Description
You are given a nested list of integers `nestedList`. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Implement the `NestedIterator` class:

- `NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList)` Initializes the iterator with the nested list `nestedList`.
- `int next()` Returns the next integer in the nested list.
- `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still some integers in the nested list and `false` otherwise.
Your code will be tested with the following pseudocode:
```
initialize iterator with nestedList
res = []
while iterator.hasNext()
    append iterator.next() to the end of res
return res
```
If `res` matches the expected flattened list, then your code will be judged as correct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
```
