# [2134.Minimum Swaps to Group All 1&#39;s Together II][title]

## Description
A **swap** is defined as taking two **distinct** positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

A **circular** array is defined as an array where we consider the **first** element and the **last** element to be **adjacent**.

Given a **binary circular** array `nums`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all  `1`'s present in the array together at **any location**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[0,0,1,1,1,0,0] using 1 swap.
[0,1,1,1,0,0,0] using 1 swap.
[1,1,0,0,0,0,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: Here are a few of the ways to group all the 1's together:
[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1] using 2 swaps (using the circular property of the array).
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] using 2 swaps.
There is no way to group all 1's together with 0 or 1 swaps.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All the 1's are already grouped together due to the circular property of the array.
Thus, the minimum number of swaps required is 0.
```
