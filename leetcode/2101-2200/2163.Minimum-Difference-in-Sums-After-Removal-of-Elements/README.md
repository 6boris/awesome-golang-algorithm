# [2163.Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.

You are allowed to remove any **subsequence** of elements of size **exactly** `n` from `nums`. The remaining `2 * n` elements will be divided into two **equal** parts:

- The first `n` elements belonging to the first part and their sum is `sumfirst`.
- The next `n` elements belonging to the second part and their sum is `sumsecond`.

The **difference in sums** of the two parts is denoted as `sumfirst - sumsecond`.

- For example, if `sumfirst = 3` and `sumsecond = 2`, their difference is `1`.
- Similarly, if `sumfirst = 2` and `sumsecond = 3`, their difference is `-1`.

Return the **minimum difference** possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of `n` elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.
```
