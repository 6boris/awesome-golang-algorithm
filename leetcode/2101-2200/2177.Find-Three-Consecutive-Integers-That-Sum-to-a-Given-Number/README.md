# [2177.Find Three Consecutive Integers That Sum to a Given Number][title]

## Description
Given an integer `num`, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that **sum** to `num`. If `num` cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an **empty** array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 33
Output: [10,11,12]
Explanation: 33 can be expressed as 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.
10, 11, 12 are 3 consecutive integers, so we return [10, 11, 12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 4
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to express 4 as the sum of 3 consecutive integers.
```
