# [2181.Merge Nodes in Between Zeros][title]

## Description
You are given the `head` of a linked list, which contains a series of integers **separated** by `0`'s. The **beginning** and **end** of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For **every** two consecutive `0`'s, **merge** all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the **sum** of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any `0`'s.

Return the `head` of the modified linked list.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./ex1-1.png)

```
Input: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]
Output: [4,11]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.
```

**Example 2:**  

![example1](./ex2-1.png)

```
Input: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]
Output: [1,3,4]
Explanation: 
The above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.
```
