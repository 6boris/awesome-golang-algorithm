# [2331.Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree][title]

## Description
You are given the `root` of a **full binary tree** with the following properties:

- **Leaf nodes** have either the value `0` or `1`, where `0` represents `False` and `1` represents `True`.
- **Non-leaf nodes** have either the value `2` or `3`, where `2` represents the boolean `OR` and `3` represents the boolean `AND`.

The `evaluation` of a node is as follows:

- If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the **value** of the node, i.e. `True` or `False`.
- Otherwise, **evaluate** the node's two children and **apply** the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.

Return the boolean result of **evaluating** the `root` node.

A **full binary** tree is a binary tree where each node has either `0` or `2` children.

A **leaf node** is a node that has zero children.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./example1drawio1.png)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node is a leaf node and it evaluates to false, so we return false.
```
