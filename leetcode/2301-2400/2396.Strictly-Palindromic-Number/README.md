# [2396.Strictly Palindromic Number][title]

## Description
An integer `n` is **strictly palindromic** if, for **every** base `b` between `2` and `n - 2` (**inclusive**), the string representation of the integer `n` in base `b` is **palindromic**.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is **strictly palindromic** and `false` otherwise.

A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: false
Explanation: In base 2: 9 = 1001 (base 2), which is palindromic.
In base 3: 9 = 100 (base 3), which is not palindromic.
Therefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic so we return false.
Note that in bases 4, 5, 6, and 7, n = 9 is also not palindromic.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: false
Explanation: We only consider base 2: 4 = 100 (base 2), which is not palindromic.
Therefore, we return false.
```
