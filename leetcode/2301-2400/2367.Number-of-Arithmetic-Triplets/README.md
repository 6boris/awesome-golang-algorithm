# [2367.Number of Arithmetic Triplets][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed, strictly increasing** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `diff`. A triplet (`i, j, k`) is an **arithmetic triplet** if the following conditions are met:

- `i < j < k`,
- `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`, and
- `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`.

Return the number of unique **arithmetic triplets**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
(1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
(2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,8,9], diff = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
(0, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 8 - 6 == 2 and 6 - 4 == 2.
(1, 3, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 9 - 7 == 2 and 7 - 5 == 2.
```
