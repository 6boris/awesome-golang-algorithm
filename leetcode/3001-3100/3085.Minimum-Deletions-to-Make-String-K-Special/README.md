# [3085.Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special][title]

## Description
You are given a string `word` and an integer `k`.

We consider `word` to be **k-special** if `|freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k` for all indices `i` and `j` in the string.

Here, `freq(x)` denotes the `frequency` of the character `x` in `word`, and `|y|` denotes the absolute value of `y`.

Return the **minimum** number of characters you need to delete to make `word` **k-special**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0

Output: 3

Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d". Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word = "aaabaaa", k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b". Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.
```
