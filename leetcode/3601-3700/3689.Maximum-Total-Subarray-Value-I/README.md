# [3689.Maximum Total Subarray Value I][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`.

You need to choose **exactly** `k` non-empty subarrays `nums[l..r]` of `nums`. Subarrays may overlap, and the exact same subarray (same `l` and `r`) **can** be chosen more than once.

The **value** of a subarray `nums[l..r]` is defined as: `max(nums[l..r]) - min(nums[l..r])`.

The **total value** is the sum of the **values** of all chosen subarrays.

Return the **maximum** possible total value you can achieve.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2], k = 2

Output: 4

Explanation:

One optimal approach is:

Choose nums[0..1] = [1, 3]. The maximum is 3 and the minimum is 1, giving a value of 3 - 1 = 2.
Choose nums[0..2] = [1, 3, 2]. The maximum is still 3 and the minimum is still 1, so the value is also 3 - 1 = 2.
Adding these gives 2 + 2 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,1], k = 3

Output: 12

Explanation:

One optimal approach is:

Choose nums[0..3] = [4, 2, 5, 1]. The maximum is 5 and the minimum is 1, giving a value of 5 - 1 = 4.
Choose nums[0..3] = [4, 2, 5, 1]. The maximum is 5 and the minimum is 1, so the value is also 4.
Choose nums[2..3] = [5, 1]. The maximum is 5 and the minimum is 1, so the value is again 4.
Adding these gives 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
```
