# [3644.Maximum K to Sort a Permutation][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` of length n, where `nums` is a permutation of the numbers in the range `[0..n - 1]`.

You may swap elements at indices `i` and `j` only if `nums[i] AND nums[j] == k`, where `AND` denotes the bitwise AND operation and `k` is a **non-negative** integer.

Return the **maximum** value of `k` such that the array can be sorted in **non-decreasing** order using any number of such swaps. If `nums` is already sorted, return 0.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,2,1]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Choose k = 1. Swapping nums[1] = 3 and nums[3] = 1 is allowed since nums[1] AND nums[3] == 1, resulting in a sorted permutation: [0, 1, 2, 3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,3,2]

Output: 2

Explanation:

Choose k = 2. Swapping nums[2] = 3 and nums[3] = 2 is allowed since nums[2] AND nums[3] == 2, resulting in a sorted permutation: [0, 1, 2, 3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0]

Output: 0

Explanation:

Only k = 0 allows sorting since no greater k allows the required swaps where nums[i] AND nums[j] == k.
```
