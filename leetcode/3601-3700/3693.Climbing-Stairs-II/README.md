# [3693.Climbing Stairs II][title]

## Description
You are climbing a staircase with `n + 1` steps, numbered from 0 to `n`.

You are also given a **1-indexed** integer array `costs` of length `n`, where `costs[i]` is the cost of step `i`.

From step `i`, you can jump **only** to step `i + 1`, `i + 2`, or `i + 3`. The cost of jumping from step `i` to step `j` is defined as: `costs[j] + (j - i)^2`

You start from step 0 with `cost = 0`.

Return the **minimum** total cost to reach step `n`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, costs = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 13

Explanation:

One optimal path is 0 → 1 → 2 → 4

Jump	Cost Calculation	Cost
0 → 1	costs[1] + (1 - 0)2 = 1 + 1	2
1 → 2	costs[2] + (2 - 1)2 = 2 + 1	3
2 → 4	costs[4] + (4 - 2)2 = 4 + 4	8
Thus, the minimum total cost is 2 + 3 + 8 = 13
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, costs = [5,1,6,2]

Output: 11

Explanation:

One optimal path is 0 → 2 → 4

Jump	Cost Calculation	Cost
0 → 2	costs[2] + (2 - 0)2 = 1 + 4	5
2 → 4	costs[4] + (4 - 2)2 = 2 + 4	6
Thus, the minimum total cost is 5 + 6 = 11
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, costs = [9,8,3]

Output: 12

Explanation:

The optimal path is 0 → 3 with total cost = costs[3] + (3 - 0)2 = 3 + 9 = 12
```
