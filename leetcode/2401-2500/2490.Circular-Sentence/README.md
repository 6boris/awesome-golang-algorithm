# [2490.Circular Sentence][title]

## Description
A **sentence** is a list of words that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces.

- For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.

Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.

A sentence is **circular** if:

- The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.
- The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.

For example, `"leetcode exercises sound delightful"`, `"eetcode"`, `"leetcode eats soul"` are all circular sentences. However, `"Leetcode is cool"`, `"happy Leetcode"`, `"Leetcode"` and `"I like Leetcode"` are **not** circular sentences.

Given a string `sentence`, return `true` if it is circular. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: sentence = "leetcode exercises sound delightful"
Output: true
Explanation: The words in sentence are ["leetcode", "exercises", "sound", "delightful"].
- leetcode's last character is equal to exercises's first character.
- exercises's last character is equal to sound's first character.
- sound's last character is equal to delightful's first character.
- delightful's last character is equal to leetcode's first character.
The sentence is circular.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sentence = "eetcode"
Output: true
Explanation: The words in sentence are ["eetcode"].
- eetcode's last character is equal to eetcode's first character.
The sentence is circular.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: sentence = "Leetcode is cool"
Output: false
Explanation: The words in sentence are ["Leetcode", "is", "cool"].
- Leetcode's last character is not equal to is's first character.
The sentence is not circular.
```
