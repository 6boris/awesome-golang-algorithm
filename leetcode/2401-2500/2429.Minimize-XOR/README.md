# [2429.Minimize XOR][title]

## Description
Given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`, find the positive integer `x` such that:

- `x` has the same number of set bits as `num2`, and
- The value `x XOR num1` is minimal.

Note that `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

Return the integer `x`. The test cases are generated such that `x` is **uniquely determined**.

The number of **set bits** of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary representation.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num1 = 1, num2 = 12
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num1 and num2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num2, and the value 3 XOR 1 = 2 is minimal.
```
