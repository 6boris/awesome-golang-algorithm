# [2415.Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree][title]

## Description
Given the root of a **perfect** binary tree, reverse the node values at each **odd** level of the tree.

- For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are `[2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18]`, then it should become `[18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2]`.

Return the root of the reversed tree.

A binary tree is **perfect** if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

The **level** of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./first_case1.png)

```
Input: root = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
Output: [2,5,3,8,13,21,34]
Explanation: 
The tree has only one odd level.
The nodes at level 1 are 3, 5 respectively, which are reversed and become 5, 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![example2](./second_case3.png)

```
Input: root = [7,13,11]
Output: [7,11,13]
Explanation: 
The nodes at level 1 are 13, 11, which are reversed and become 11, 13.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: [0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1]
Explanation: 
The odd levels have non-zero values.
The nodes at level 1 were 1, 2, and are 2, 1 after the reversal.
The nodes at level 3 were 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, and are 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 after the reversal.
```
