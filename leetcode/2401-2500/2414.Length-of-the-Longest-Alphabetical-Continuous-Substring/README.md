# [2414.Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring][title]

## Description
An **alphabetical continuous string** is a string consisting of consecutive letters in the alphabet. In other words, it is any substring of the string `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`.

- For example, `"abc"` is an alphabetical continuous string, while `"acb"` and `"za"` are not.

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters only, return the length of the **longest** alphabetical continuous substring.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 4 distinct continuous substrings: "a", "b", "c" and "ab".
"ab" is the longest continuous substring.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcde"
Output: 5
Explanation: "abcde" is the longest continuous substring.
```
