# [2419.Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`.

Consider a **non-empty** subarray from `nums` that has the **maximum** possible **bitwise AND**.

- In other words, let `k` be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of **any** subarray of `nums`. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to `k` should be considered.
Return the length of the longest such subarray.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A **subarray** is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 3.
The longest subarray with that value is [3,3], so we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise AND of a subarray is 4.
The longest subarray with that value is [4], so we return 1.
```
