# [2461.Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following conditions:

- The length of the subarray is `k`, and
- All the elements of the subarray are **distinct**.

Return the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions. If no subarray meets the conditions, return `0`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
```
