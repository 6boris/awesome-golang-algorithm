# [1696.Jump Game VI][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

You are initially standing at index `0`. In one move, you can jump at most `k` steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index `i` to any index in the range `[i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)]` **inclusive**.

You want to reach the last index of the array (index `n - 1`). Your `score` is the `sum` of all `nums[j]` for each index `j` you visited in the array.

Return the `maximum score` you can get.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,-1,-2,4,-7,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [1,-1,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [10,-5,-2,4,0,3], k = 3
Output: 17
Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [10,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 17.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,-5,-20,4,-1,3,-6,-3], k = 2
Output: 0
```
