# [1652.Defuse the Bomb][title]

## Description
You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a **circular** array `code` of length of `n` and a key `k`.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced **simultaneously**.

- If `k > 0`, replace the `ith` number with the sum of the **next** `k` numbers.
- If `k < 0`, replace the `ith` number with the sum of the **previous** `k` numbers.
- If `k == 0`, replace the `ith` number with `0`.

As `code` is circular, the next element of `code[n-1]` is `code[0]`, and the previous element of `code[0]` is `code[n-1]`.

Given the **circular** array `code` and an integer key `k`, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!

**Example 1:**

```
Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation: When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2
Output: [12,5,6,13]
Explanation: The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of the previous numbers.
```
