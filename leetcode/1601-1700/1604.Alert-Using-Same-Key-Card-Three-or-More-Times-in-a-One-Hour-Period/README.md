# [1604.Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period][title]

## Description
LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an **alert** if any worker uses the key-card **three or more times** in a one-hour period.

You are given a list of strings `keyName` and `keyTime` where `[keyName[i], keyTime[i]]` corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used **in a single day**.

Access times are given in the **24-hour time format "HH:MM"**, such as `"23:51"` and `"09:49"`.

Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in **ascending order alphabetically**.

Notice that `"10:00"` - `"11:00"` is considered to be within a one-hour period, while `"22:51"` - `"23:52"` is not considered to be within a one-hour period.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: keyName = ["daniel","daniel","daniel","luis","luis","luis","luis"], keyTime = ["10:00","10:40","11:00","09:00","11:00","13:00","15:00"]
Output: ["daniel"]
Explanation: "daniel" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period ("10:00","10:40", "11:00").
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: keyName = ["alice","alice","alice","bob","bob","bob","bob"], keyTime = ["12:01","12:00","18:00","21:00","21:20","21:30","23:00"]
Output: ["bob"]
Explanation: "bob" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period ("21:00","21:20", "21:30").
```
