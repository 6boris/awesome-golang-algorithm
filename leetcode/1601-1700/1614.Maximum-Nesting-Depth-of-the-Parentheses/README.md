# [1614.Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses][title]

## Description
A string is a **valid parentheses string** (denoted **VPS**) if it meets one of the following:

- It is an empty string `""`, or a single character not equal to `"("` or `")"`,
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are **VPS**'s, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a `VPS`.

We can similarly define the **nesting depth** `depth(S)` of any VPS `S` as follows:

- `depth("") = 0`
- `depth(C) = 0`, where `C` is a string with a single character not equal to `"("` or `")"`.
- `depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))`, where `A` and `B` are **VPS**'s.
- `depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A)`, where `A` is a **VPS**.

For example, `""`, `"()()"`, and `"()(()())"` are **VPS**'s (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and `")("` and `"(()"` are not **VPS**'s.

Given a **VPS** represented as string `s`, return the **nesting depth** of `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "(1+(2*3)+((8)/4))+1"
Output: 3
Explanation: Digit 8 is inside of 3 nested parentheses in the string.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "(1)+((2))+(((3)))"
Output: 3
```
