# [2894.Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference][title]

## Description
You are given positive integers `n` and `m`.

Define two integers as follows:

- `num1`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` (both **inclusive**) that are **not divisible** by `m`.
- `num2`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` (both **inclusive**) that are **divisible** by `m`.

Return the integer `num1 - num2`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, m = 6
Output: 15
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are not divisible by 6 are [1,2,3,4,5], num1 is the sum of those integers = 15.
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are divisible by 6 are [], num2 is the sum of those integers = 0.
We return 15 - 0 = 15 as the answer.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, m = 1
Output: -15
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are not divisible by 1 are [], num1 is the sum of those integers = 0.
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are divisible by 1 are [1,2,3,4,5], num2 is the sum of those integers = 15.
We return 0 - 15 = -15 as the answer.
```
