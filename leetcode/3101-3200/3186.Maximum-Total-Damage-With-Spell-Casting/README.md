# [3186.Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting][title]

## Description
A magician has various spells.

You are given an array `power`, where each element represents the damage of a spell. Multiple spells can have the same damage value.

It is a known fact that if a magician decides to cast a spell with a damage of `power[i]`, they **cannot** cast any spell with a damage of `power[i] - 2`, `power[i] - 1`, `power[i] + 1`, or `power[i] + 2`.

Each spell can be cast **only once**.

Return the **maximum** possible total damage that a magician can cast.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: power = [1,1,3,4]

Output: 6

Explanation:

The maximum possible damage of 6 is produced by casting spells 0, 1, 3 with damage 1, 1, 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: power = [7,1,6,6]

Output: 13

Explanation:

The maximum possible damage of 13 is produced by casting spells 1, 2, 3 with damage 1, 6, 6.
```
