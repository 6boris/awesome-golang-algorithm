# [3159.Find Occurrences of an Element in an Array][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums`, an integer array `queries`, and an integer `x`.

For each `queries[i]`, you need to find the index of the `queries[i]th` occurrence of `x` in the `nums` array. If there are fewer than `queries[i]` occurrences of `x`, the answer should be -1 for that query.

Return an integer array `answer` containing the answers to all queries.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,1,7], queries = [1,3,2,4], x = 1

Output: [0,-1,2,-1]

Explanation:

For the 1st query, the first occurrence of 1 is at index 0.
For the 2nd query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in nums, so the answer is -1.
For the 3rd query, the second occurrence of 1 is at index 2.
For the 4th query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in nums, so the answer is -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], queries = [10], x = 5

Output: [-1]

Explanation:

For the 1st query, 5 doesn't exist in nums, so the answer is -1.
```
