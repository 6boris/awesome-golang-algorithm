# [1235.Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling][title]

## Description
We have `n` jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from `startTime[i]` to `endTime[i]`, obtaining a profit of `profit[i]`.

You're given the `startTime`, `endTime` and `profit` arrays, return the maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time `X` you will be able to start another job that starts at time `X`.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./sample1_1584.png)

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./sample22_1584.png)

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.
```

**Example 3:**  

![example3](./sample3_1584.png)

```
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
```
