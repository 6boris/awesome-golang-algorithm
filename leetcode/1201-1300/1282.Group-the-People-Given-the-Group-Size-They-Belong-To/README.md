# [1282.Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To][title]

## Description
There are `n` people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a **unique ID** from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is the size of the group that person `i` is in. For example, if `groupSizes[1] = 3`, then person `1` must be in a group of size `3`.

Return a list of groups such that each person `i` is in a group of size `groupSizes[i]`.

Each person should appear in **exactly one group**, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, **return any of them**. It is **guaranteed** that there will be **at least one** valid solution for the given input.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
Output: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
Explanation: 
The first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.
The second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.
The third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.
Other possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
Output: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
```
