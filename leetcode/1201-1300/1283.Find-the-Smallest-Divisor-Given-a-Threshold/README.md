# [1283.Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold][title]

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer `divisor`, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's result. Find the **smallest** `divisor` such that the result mentioned above is less than or equal to `threshold`.

Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or equal to that element. (For example: `7/3 = 3` and `10/2 = 5`).

The test cases are generated so that there will be an answer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1. 
If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5 the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [44,22,33,11,1], threshold = 5
Output: 44
```
