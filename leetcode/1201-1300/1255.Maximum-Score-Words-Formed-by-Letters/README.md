# [1255.Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters][title]

## Description
Given a list of `words`, list of  single `letters` (might be repeating) and `score` of every character.

Return the maximum score of **any** valid set of words formed by using the given letters (`words[i]` cannot be used two or more times).

It is not necessary to use all characters in `letters` and each letter can only be used once. Score of letters `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`, ... ,`'z'` is given by `score[0]`, `score[1]`, ... , `score[25]` respectively.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["dog","cat","dad","good"], letters = ["a","a","c","d","d","d","g","o","o"], score = [1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 23
Explanation:
Score  a=1, c=9, d=5, g=3, o=2
Given letters, we can form the words "dad" (5+1+5) and "good" (3+2+2+5) with a score of 23.
Words "dad" and "dog" only get a score of 21.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["xxxz","ax","bx","cx"], letters = ["z","a","b","c","x","x","x"], score = [4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,10]
Output: 27
Explanation:
Score  a=4, b=4, c=4, x=5, z=10
Given letters, we can form the words "ax" (4+5), "bx" (4+5) and "cx" (4+5) with a score of 27.
Word "xxxz" only get a score of 25.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["leetcode"], letters = ["l","e","t","c","o","d"], score = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
