# [1262.Greatest Sum Divisible by Three][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the **maximum possible sum** of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
Output: 18
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
```
