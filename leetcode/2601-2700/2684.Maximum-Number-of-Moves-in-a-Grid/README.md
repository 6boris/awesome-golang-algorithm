# [1001.Grid Illumination][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of **positive** integers.

You can start at **any** cell in the first column of the matrix, and traverse the grid in the following way:

- From a cell `(row, col)`, you can move to any of the cells: `(row - 1, col + 1)`, `(row, col + 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` such that the value of the cell you move to, should be **strictly** bigger than the value of the current cell.

Return the **maximum** number of **moves** that you can perform.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[2,4,3,5],[5,4,9,3],[3,4,2,11],[10,9,13,15]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can start at the cell (0, 0) and make the following moves:
- (0, 0) -> (0, 1).
- (0, 1) -> (1, 2).
- (1, 2) -> (2, 3).
It can be shown that it is the maximum number of moves that can be made.
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./2.png)

```
Input: grid = [[3,2,4],[2,1,9],[1,1,7]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Starting from any cell in the first column we cannot perform any moves.
```
