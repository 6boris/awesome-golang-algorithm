# [2657.Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays][title]

## Description
You are given two **0-indexed** integer permutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index `i` in both `A` and `B`.

Return the **prefix common array** of `A` and `B`.

A sequence of `n` integers is called a **permutation** if it contains all integers from `1` to `n` exactly once.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [0,2,3,4]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
```
