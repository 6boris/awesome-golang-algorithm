# [2652.Sum Multiples][title]

## Description
Given a positive integer `n`, find the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` **inclusive** that are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 21
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 40
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: 30
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 9] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. The sum of these numbers is 30.
