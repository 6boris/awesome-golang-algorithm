# [1447.Simplified Fractions][title]

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return a list of all **simplified** fractions between `0` and `1` (exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than-or-equal-to `n`. You can return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: ["1/2"]
Explanation: "1/2" is the only unique fraction with a denominator less-than-or-equal-to 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1/2","1/3","2/3"]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: ["1/2","1/3","1/4","2/3","3/4"]
Explanation: "2/4" is not a simplified fraction because it can be simplified to "1/2".
```
