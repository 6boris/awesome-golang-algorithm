# [1493.Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element][title]

## Description
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only `1`'s in the resulting array. Return `0` if there is no such subarray.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.
