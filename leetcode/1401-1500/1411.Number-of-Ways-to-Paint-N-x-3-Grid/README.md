# [1411.Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid][title]

## Description
You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: **Red**, **Yellow**, or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given `n` the number of rows of the `grid`, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**
