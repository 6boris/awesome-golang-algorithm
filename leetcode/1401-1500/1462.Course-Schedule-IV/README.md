# [1462.Course Schedule IV][title]

## Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `ai` first if you want to take course `bi`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]` indicates that you have to take course `0` before you can take course `1`.

Prerequisites can also be **indirect**. If course `a` is a prerequisite of course `b`, and course `b` is a prerequisite of course `c`, then course `a` is a prerequisite of course `c`.

You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [uj, vj]`. For the `jth` query, you should answer whether course `uj` is a prerequisite of course `vj` or not.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `jth` query.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./courses4-1-graph.jpeg)

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The pair [1, 0] indicates that you have to take course 1 before you can take course 0.
Course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1, but the opposite is true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: [false,false]
Explanation: There are no prerequisites, and each course is independent.
```

**Example 3:**  

![2](./courses4-3-graph.jpeg)

```
Input: numCourses = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]
Output: [true,true]
```
