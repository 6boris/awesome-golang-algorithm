# [1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `target` and an integer `n`.

You have an empty stack with the two following operations:

- `"Push"`: pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
- `"Pop"`: removes the integer on the top of the stack.

You also have a stream of the integers in the range `[1, n]`.

Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to `target`. You should follow the following rules:

- If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.
- If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
- If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to `target`, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.
Return the stack operations needed to build `target` following the mentioned rules. If there are multiple valid answers, return **any of them**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Pop the integer on the top of the stack. s = [1].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Read 3 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2,3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
Explanation: Initially the stack s is empty. The last element is the top of the stack.
Read 1 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1].
Read 2 from the stream and push it to the stack. s = [1,2].
Since the stack (from the bottom to the top) is equal to target, we stop the stack operations.
The answers that read integer 3 from the stream are not accepted.
```
