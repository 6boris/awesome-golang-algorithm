# [1311.Get Watched Videos by Your Friends][title]

## Description
There are `n` people, each person has a unique id between `0` and `n-1`. Given the arrays `watchedVideos` and `friends`, where `watchedVideos[i]` and `friends[i]` contain the list of watched videos and the list of friends respectively for the person with `id = i`.

Level **1** of videos are all watched videos by your friends, level **2** of videos are all watched videos by the friends of your friends and so on. In general, the level `k` of videos are all watched videos by people with the shortest path **exactly** equal to `k` with you. Given your `id` and the `level` of videos, return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies (increasing). For videos with the same frequency order them alphabetically from least to greatest. 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: watchedVideos = [["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]], friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], id = 0, level = 1
Output: ["B","C"] 
Explanation: 
You have id = 0 (green color in the figure) and your friends are (yellow color in the figure):
Person with id = 1 -> watchedVideos = ["C"] 
Person with id = 2 -> watchedVideos = ["B","C"] 
The frequencies of watchedVideos by your friends are: 
B -> 1 
C -> 2
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./2.png)

```
Input: watchedVideos = [["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]], friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], id = 0, level = 2
Output: ["D"]
Explanation: 
You have id = 0 (green color in the figure) and the only friend of your friends is the person with id = 3 (yellow color in the figure).
