# [1391. Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid][title]

## Description
You are given an `m x n` `grid`. Each cell of `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:

- `1` which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
- `2` which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
- `3` which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
- `4` which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
- `5` which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
- `6` which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0, 0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell `(0, 0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. **The path should only follow the streets**.

**Notice** that you are **not allowed** to change any street.

Return `true` if there is a valid path in the grid or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**  

![e1](./e1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).
```

**Example 2:**  

![e2](./e1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).
```
