# [1374.Generate a String With Characters That Have Odd Counts][title]

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return a string with `n` characters such that each character in such string occurs **an odd number of times**.

The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return **any** of them.  

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: "xy"
Explanation: "xy" is a valid string since the characters 'x' and 'y' occur once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ag" and "ur".
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: "holasss"
```
