# [1390.Four Divisors][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors. If there is no such integer in the array, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [21,4,7]
Output: 32
Explanation: 
21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [21,21]
Output: 64
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
```
