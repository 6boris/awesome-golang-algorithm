# [1375.Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix-Aligned][title]

## Description
You have a **1-indexed** binary string of length `n` where all the bits are `0` initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from `0` to `1`) one by one. You are given a **1-indexed** integer array `flips` where `flips[i]` indicates that the bit at index `i` will be flipped in the `ith` step.

A binary string is **prefix-aligned** if, after the `ith` step, all the bits in the **inclusive** range `[1, i]` are ones and all the other bits are zeros.

Return the number of times the binary string is **prefix-aligned** during the flipping process.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flips = [3,2,4,1,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary string is initially "00000".
After applying step 1: The string becomes "00100", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 2: The string becomes "01100", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 3: The string becomes "01110", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 4: The string becomes "11110", which is prefix-aligned.
After applying step 5: The string becomes "11111", which is prefix-aligned.
We can see that the string was prefix-aligned 2 times, so we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flips = [4,1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: The binary string is initially "0000".
After applying step 1: The string becomes "0001", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 2: The string becomes "1001", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 3: The string becomes "1101", which is not prefix-aligned.
After applying step 4: The string becomes "1111", which is prefix-aligned.
We can see that the string was prefix-aligned 1 time, so we return 1.
```
