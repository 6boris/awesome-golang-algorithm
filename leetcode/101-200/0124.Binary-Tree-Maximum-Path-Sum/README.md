# [124.Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum][title]

## Description
A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path.

**Example 1:**  
![example1](./exx1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**  
![example2](./exx2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```
