# [1834.Single-Threaded CPU][title]

## Description
You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the i<sup>th</sup> task will be available to process at enqueueTime<sub>i</sub> and will take processingTime<sub>i</sub> to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process **at most one** task at a time and will act in the following way:

- If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
- If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the **shortest processing time**. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
- Once a task is started, the CPU will **process the entire task** without stopping.
- The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]]
Output: [0,2,3,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows: 
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tasks = [[7,10],[7,12],[7,5],[7,4],[7,2]]
Output: [4,3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The events go as follows:
- At time = 7, all the tasks become available. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3,4}.
- Also at time = 7, the idle CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3}.
- At time = 9, the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks = {0,1,2}.
- At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 2. Available tasks = {0,1}.
- At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 28, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.
```
