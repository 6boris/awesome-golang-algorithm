# [769.Max Chunks To Make Sorted][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n` that represents a permutation of the integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

We split `arr` into some number of **chunks** (i.e., partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result should equal the sorted array.

Return the largest number of chunks we can make to sort the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```
