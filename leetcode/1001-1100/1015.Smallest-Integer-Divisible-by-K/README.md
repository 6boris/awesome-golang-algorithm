# [1015.Smallest Integer Divisible by K][title]

## Description
Given a positive integer `k`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest** positive integer `n` such that `n` is divisible by `k`, and `n` only contains the digit `1`.

Return the **length** of `n`. If there is no such `n`, return -1.

**Note**: `n` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
```
