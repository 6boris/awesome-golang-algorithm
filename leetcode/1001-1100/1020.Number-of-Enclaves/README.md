# [1020.Number of Enclaves][title]

## Description
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`, where `0` represents a sea cell and `1` represents a land cell.

A **move** consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (**4-directionally**) land cell or walking off the boundary of the `grid`.

Return the number of land cells in `grid` for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of **moves**.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./enclaves1.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./enclaves2.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.
```
