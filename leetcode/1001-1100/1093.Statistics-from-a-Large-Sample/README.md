# [1093.Statistics from a Large Sample][title]

## Description
You are given a large sample of integers in the range `[0, 255]`. Since the sample is so large, it is represented by an array `count` where `count[k]` is the **number of times** that `k` appears in the sample.

Calculate the following statistics:

- `minimum`: The minimum element in the sample.
- `maximum`: The maximum element in the sample.
- `mean`: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
- `median`:

    - If the sample has an odd number of elements, then the `median` is the middle element once the sample is sorted.
    - If the sample has an even number of elements, then the `median` is the average of the two middle elements once the sample is sorted.

- `mode`: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be **unique**.

Return the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point numbers `[minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]`. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 3 respectively.
The mean is (1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3) / 8 = 19 / 8 = 2.375.
Since the size of the sample is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements 2 and 3, which is 2.5.
The mode is 3 as it appears the most in the sample.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].
The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.
The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).
Since the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.
The mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.
