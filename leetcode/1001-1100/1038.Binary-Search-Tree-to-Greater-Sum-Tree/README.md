# [1038.Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree][title]

## Description
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./tree.png)

```
Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [0,null,1]
Output: [1,null,1]
```
