# [1026.Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor][title]

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `v` for which there exist **different** nodes `a` and `b` where `v = |a.val - b.val|` and `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

A node `a` is an ancestor of `b` if either: any child of `a` is equal to `b` any child of `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

**Example 1:**  
![example1](./tmp-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```

**Example 2:**  
![example2](./tmp-tree-1.jpg)  

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
Output: 3
```
