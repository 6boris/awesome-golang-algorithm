# [1051.Height Checker][title]

## Description
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the i<sup>th</sup> student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the i<sup>th</sup> student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return the **number of indices** where `heights[i] != expected[i]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.
```
