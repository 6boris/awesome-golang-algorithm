# [1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String][title]

## Description
You are given two strings of the same length `s1` and `s2` and a string `baseStr`.

We say `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are equivalent characters.

- For example, if `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "cde"`, then we have `'a' == 'c'`, `'b' == 'd'`, and `'c' == 'e'`.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:

- **Reflexivity**: `'a' == 'a'`.
- **Symmetry**: `'a' == 'b'` implies `'b' == 'a'`.
- **Transitivity**: `'a' == 'b'` and `'b' == 'c'` implies `'a' == 'c'`.

For example, given the equivalency information from `s1 = "abc"` and `s2 = "cde"`, `"acd"` and `"aab"` are equivalent strings of `baseStr = "eed"`, and `"aab"` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr`.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr` by using the equivalency information from `s1` and `s2`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
Output: "makkek"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [m,p], [a,o], [k,r,s], [e,i].
The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order.
So the answer is "makkek".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"
Output: "hdld"
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in s1 and s2, we can group their characters as [h,w], [d,e,o], [l,r].
So only the second letter 'o' in baseStr is changed to 'd', the answer is "hdld".
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "programs", baseStr = "sourcecode"
Output: "aauaaaaada"
Explanation: We group the equivalent characters in s1 and s2 as [a,o,e,r,s,c], [l,p], [g,t] and [d,m], thus all letters in baseStr except 'u' and 'd' are transformed to 'a', the answer is "aauaaaaada".
```
