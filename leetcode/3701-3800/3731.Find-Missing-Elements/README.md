# [3731.Find Missing Elements][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of **unique** integers.

Originally, `nums` contained **every integer** within a certain range. However, some integers might have gone **missing** from the array.

The **smallest** and **largest** integers of the original range are still present in `nums`.

Return a **sorted** list of all the missing integers in this range. If no integers are missing, return an **empty** list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,4,2,5]

Output: [3]

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. Among these, only 3 is missing.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,8,6,9]

Output: []

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 6 and the largest is 9, so the full range is [6,7,8,9]. All integers are already present, so no integer is missing.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [5,1]

Output: [2,3,4]

Explanation:

The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. The missing integers are 2, 3, and 4.
```
