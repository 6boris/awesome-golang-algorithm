# [3719.Longest Balanced Subarray I][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums`.

A subarray is called **balanced** if the number of **distinct even** numbers in the subarray is equal to the number of **distinct odd** numbers.

Return the length of the **longest** balanced subarray.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,4,3]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest balanced subarray is [2, 5, 4, 3].
It has 2 distinct even numbers [2, 4] and 2 distinct odd numbers [5, 3]. Thus, the answer is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,5,4]

Output: 5

Explanation:

The longest balanced subarray is [3, 2, 2, 5, 4].
It has 2 distinct even numbers [2, 4] and 2 distinct odd numbers [3, 5]. Thus, the answer is 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The longest balanced subarray is [2, 3, 2].
It has 1 distinct even number [2] and 1 distinct odd number [3]. Thus, the answer is 3.
