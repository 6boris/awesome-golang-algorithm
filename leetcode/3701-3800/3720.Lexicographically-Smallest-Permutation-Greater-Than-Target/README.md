# [3720.Lexicographically Smallest Permutation Greater Than Target][title]

## Description
You are given two strings `s` and `target`, both having length `n`, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Return the **lexicographically smallest permutation** of `s` that is **strictly** greater than `target`. If no permutation of `s` is lexicographically strictly greater than `target`, return an empty string.

A string `a` is **lexicographically strictly greater** than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", target = "bba"

Output: "bca"

Explanation:

The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", and "cba".
The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "bca".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "leet", target = "code"

Output: "eelt"

Explanation:

The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "eelt", "eetl", "elet", "elte", "etel", "etle", "leet", "lete", "ltee", "teel", "tele", and "tlee".
The lexicographically smallest permutation that is strictly greater than target is "eelt".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "baba", target = "bbaa"

Output: ""

Explanation:

The permutations of s (in lexicographical order) are "aabb", "abab", "abba", "baab", "baba", and "bbaa".
None of them is lexicographically strictly greater than target. Therefore, the answer is "".
```
