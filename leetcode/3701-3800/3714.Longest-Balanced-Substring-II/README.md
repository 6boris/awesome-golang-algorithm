# [3714.Longest Balanced Substring II][title]

## Description
You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.

A **substring** of `s` is called **balanced** if all **distinct** characters in the **substring** appear the **same** number of times.

Return the **length of the longest balanced substring** of `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abbac"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest balanced substring is "abba" because both distinct characters 'a' and 'b' each appear exactly 2 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aabcc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

The longest balanced substring is "abc" because all distinct characters 'a', 'b' and 'c' each appear exactly 1 time.
```

**Example 3: **

```
Input: s = "aba"

Output: 2

Explanation:

One of the longest balanced substrings is "ab" because both distinct characters 'a' and 'b' each appear exactly 1 time. Another longest balanced substring is "ba".
```
