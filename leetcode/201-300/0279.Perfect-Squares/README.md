# [279.Perfect Squares][title]

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```
