# [210.Course Schedule II][title]

## Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course b<sub>i</sub> first if you want to take course a<sub>i</sub>.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course `1`.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```
