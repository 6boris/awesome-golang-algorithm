# [212.Word Search II][title]

## Description
Given an `m x n` `board` of characters and a list of strings `words`, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially **adjacent cells**, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./1.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./2.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []
```
