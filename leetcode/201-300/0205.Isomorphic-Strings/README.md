# [205.Isomorphic Strings][title]


## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
