# [260.Single Number III][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in **any order**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear runtime complexity and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
Explanation:  [5, 3] is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0]
Output: [-1,0]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: [1,0]
```
