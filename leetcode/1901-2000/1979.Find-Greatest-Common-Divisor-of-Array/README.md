# [1979.Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the **greatest common divisor** of the smallest number and largest number in `nums`.

The **greatest common divisor** of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.
```


**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.
```
