# [1931.Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors][title]

## Description
You are given two integers `m` and `n`. Consider an m x n grid where each cell is initially white. You can paint each cell **red**, **green**, or **blue**. All cells **must** be painted.

Return the number of ways to color the grid with **no two adjacent cells having the same color**. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./1.png)

```
Input: m = 1, n = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The three possible colorings are shown in the image above.
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./2.png)

```
Input: m = 1, n = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The six possible colorings are shown in the image above.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: m = 5, n = 5
Output: 580986
```
