# [1985.Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array][title]

## Description
You are given an array of strings `nums` and an integer `k`. Each string in `nums` represents an integer without leading zeros.

Return the string that represents the k<sup>th</sup> **largest integer** in `nums`.

**Note**: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if `nums` is `["1","2","2"]`, `"2"` is the first largest integer, `"2"` is the second-largest integer, and `"1"` is the third-largest integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4
Output: "3"
Explanation:
The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["3","6","7","10"].
The 4th largest integer in nums is "3".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = ["2","21","12","1"], k = 3
Output: "2"
Explanation:
The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["1","2","12","21"].
The 3rd largest integer in nums is "2".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = ["0","0"], k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation:
The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["0","0"].
The 2nd largest integer in nums is "0".
```
