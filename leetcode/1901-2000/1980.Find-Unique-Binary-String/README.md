# [1980.Find Unique Binary String][title]

## Description
Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` **unique** binary strings each of length `n`, return a binary string of length `n` that **does not appear** in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return **any** of them.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = ["111","011","001"]
Output: "101"
Explanation: "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.
```
