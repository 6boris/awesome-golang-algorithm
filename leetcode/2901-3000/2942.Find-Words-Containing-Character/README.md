# [2942.Find Words Containing Character][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a character `x`.

Return an **array of indices** representing the words that contain the character `x`.

**Note** that the returned array may be in **any** order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.
```
