# [528.Random Pick with Weight][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** array of positive integers `w` where `w[i]` describes the **weight** of the `ith` index.

You need to implement the function `pickIndex()`, which **randomly** picks an index in the range `[0, w.length - 1]` (**inclusive**) and returns it. The **probability** of picking an index i is `w[i] / sum(w)`.

- For example, if `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e., `25%`), and the probability of picking index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e., `75%`).

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. The only option is to return 0 since there is only one element in w.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It is returning the second element (index = 1) that has a probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It is returning the first element (index = 0) that has a probability of 1/4.

Since this is a randomization problem, multiple answers are allowed.
All of the following outputs can be considered correct:
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
[null,1,1,1,1,1]
[null,1,1,1,0,0]
[null,1,1,1,0,1]
[null,1,0,1,0,0]
......
and so on.
```
