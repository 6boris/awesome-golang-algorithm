# [599.Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists][title]

## Description
Given two arrays of strings `list1` and `list2`, find the **common strings with the least index sum**.

A **common string** is a string that appeared in both `list1` and `list2`.

A **common string with the least index sum** is a common string such that if it appeared at `list1[i]` and `list2[j]` then `i + j` should be the minimum value among all the other common **strings**.

Return all the **common strings with the least index sum**. Return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
Output: ["sad","happy"]
Explanation: There are three common strings:
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
```
