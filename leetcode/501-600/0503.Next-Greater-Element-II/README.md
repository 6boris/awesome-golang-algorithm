# [503.Next Greater Element II][title]

## Description
Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]`), return the **next greater number** for every element in `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```
