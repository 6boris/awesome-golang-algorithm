# [2226.Maximum Candies Allocated to K Children][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `candies`. Each element in the array denotes a pile of candies of size `candies[i]`. You can divide each pile into any number of **sub piles**, but you **cannot** merge two piles together.

You are also given an integer `k`. You should allocate piles of candies to `k` children such that each child gets the **same** number of candies. Each child can be allocated candies from **only one** pile of candies and some piles of candies may go unused.

Return the **maximum number of candies** each child can get.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candies = [5,8,6], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: We can divide candies[1] into 2 piles of size 5 and 3, and candies[2] into 2 piles of size 5 and 1. We now have five piles of candies of sizes 5, 5, 3, 5, and 1. We can allocate the 3 piles of size 5 to 3 children. It can be proven that each child cannot receive more than 5 candies.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candies = [2,5], k = 11
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 11 children but only 7 candies in total, so it is impossible to ensure each child receives at least one candy. Thus, each child gets no candy and the answer is 0.
```
