# [2239.Find Closest Number to Zero][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums` of size n, return the number with the value **closest** to `0` in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the `largest` value.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,-1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.
```
