# [2244.Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the **same difficulty** level.

Return the **minimum** rounds required to complete all the tasks, or -1 if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: tasks = [2,2,3,3,2,4,4,4,4,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: To complete all the tasks, a possible plan is:
- In the first round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 2. 
- In the second round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 3. 
- In the third round, you complete 3 tasks of difficulty level 4. 
- In the fourth round, you complete 2 tasks of difficulty level 4.  
It can be shown that all the tasks cannot be completed in fewer than 4 rounds, so the answer is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: tasks = [2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is only 1 task of difficulty level 2, but in each round, you can only complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Hence, you cannot complete all the tasks, and the answer is -1.
```
