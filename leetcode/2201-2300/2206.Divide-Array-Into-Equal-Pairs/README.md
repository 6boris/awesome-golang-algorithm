# [2206.Divide Array Into Equal Pairs][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `2 * n` integers.

You need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that:

- Each element belongs to **exactly one** pair.
- The elements present in a pair are **equal**.

Return `true` if nums can be divided into `n` pairs, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: 
There are 6 elements in nums, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.
If nums is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide nums into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.
```
