# [2279.Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks][title]

## Description
You have `n` bags numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `capacity` and `rocks`. The i<sup>th</sup> bag can hold a maximum of `capacity[i]` rocks and currently contains `rocks[i]` rocks. You are also given an integer `additionalRocks`, the number of additional rocks you can place in **any** of the bags.

Return the **maximum** number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: capacity = [2,3,4,5], rocks = [1,2,4,4], additionalRocks = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
Place 1 rock in bag 0 and 1 rock in bag 1.
The number of rocks in each bag are now [2,3,4,4].
Bags 0, 1, and 2 have full capacity.
There are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3.
It can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity.
Note that there may be other ways of placing the rocks that result in an answer of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: capacity = [10,2,2], rocks = [2,2,0], additionalRocks = 100
Output: 3
Explanation:
Place 8 rocks in bag 0 and 2 rocks in bag 2.
The number of rocks in each bag are now [10,2,2].
Bags 0, 1, and 2 have full capacity.
There are 3 bags at full capacity, so we return 3.
It can be shown that it is not possible to have more than 3 bags at full capacity.
Note that we did not use all of the additional rocks.
```
