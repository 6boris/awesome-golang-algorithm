# [2275.Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero][title]

## Description
The **bitwise AND** of an array `nums` is the bitwise AND of all integers in `nums`.

- For example, for `nums = [1, 5, 3]`, the bitwise AND is equal to `1 & 5 & 3 = 1`.
- Also, for `nums = [7]`, the bitwise AND is `7`.

You are given an array of positive integers `candidates`. Evaluate the **bitwise AND** of every **combination** of numbers of `candidates`. Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in each combination.

Return the size of the **largest** combination of `candidats` with a bitwise AND **greater** than `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: candidates = [16,17,71,62,12,24,14]
Output: 4
Explanation: The combination [16,17,62,24] has a bitwise AND of 16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16 > 0.
The size of the combination is 4.
It can be shown that no combination with a size greater than 4 has a bitwise AND greater than 0.
Note that more than one combination may have the largest size.
For example, the combination [62,12,24,14] has a bitwise AND of 62 & 12 & 24 & 14 = 8 > 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: candidates = [8,8]
Output: 2
Explanation: The largest combination [8,8] has a bitwise AND of 8 & 8 = 8 > 0.
The size of the combination is 2, so we return 2.
```
