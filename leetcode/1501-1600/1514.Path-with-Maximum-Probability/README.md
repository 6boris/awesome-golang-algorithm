# [1514.Path with Maximum Probability][title]

## Description
You are given an undirected weighted graph of n nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is an undirected edge connecting the nodes `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from `start` to `end`, **return 0**. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most **1e-5**.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./1558_ex1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
```

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./1558_ex2.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.30000
```

**Example 3:**  

![example3](./1558_ex3.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 0.00000
Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.
```
