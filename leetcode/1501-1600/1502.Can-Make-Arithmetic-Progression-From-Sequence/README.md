# [1502.Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence][title]


## Description
A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` if the array can be rearranged to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
```
