# [3392.Count Subarrays of Length Three With a Condition][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of subarrays of length 3 such that the sum of the first and third numbers equals exactly half of the second number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,4,1]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only the subarray [1,4,1] contains exactly 3 elements where the sum of the first and third numbers equals half the middle number.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]

Output: 0

Explanation:

[1,1,1] is the only subarray of length 3. However, its first and third numbers do not add to half the middle number.
```
