# [3364.Minimum Positive Sum Subarray ][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and **two** integers `l` and `r`. Your task is to find the **minimum** sum of a **subarray** whose size is between `l` and `r` (inclusive) and whose sum is greater than 0.

Return the **minimum** sum of such a subarray. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3, -2, 1, 4], l = 2, r = 3

Output: 1

Explanation:

The subarrays of length between l = 2 and r = 3 where the sum is greater than 0 are:

[3, -2] with a sum of 1
[1, 4] with a sum of 5
[3, -2, 1] with a sum of 2
[-2, 1, 4] with a sum of 3
Out of these, the subarray [3, -2] has a sum of 1, which is the smallest positive sum. Hence, the answer is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-2, 2, -3, 1], l = 2, r = 3

Output: -1

Explanation:

There is no subarray of length between l and r that has a sum greater than 0. So, the answer is -1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
nput: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], l = 2, r = 4

Output: 3

Explanation:

The subarray [1, 2] has a length of 2 and the minimum sum greater than 0. So, the answer is 3.
```
