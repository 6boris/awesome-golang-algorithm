# [3342.Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room II][title]

## Description
There is a dungeon with `n x m` rooms arranged as a grid.

You are given a 2D array `moveTime` of size `n x m`, where `moveTime[i][j]` represents the **minimum** time in seconds when you can **start moving** to that room. You start from the room `(0, 0)` at time `t = 0` and can move to an **adjacent** room. Moving between **adjacent** rooms takes one second for one move and two seconds for the next, **alternating** between the two.

Return the **minimum** time to reach the room `(n - 1, m - 1)`.

Two rooms are **adjacent** if they share a common wall, either horizontally or vertically.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: moveTime = [[0,4],[4,4]]

Output: 7

Explanation:

The minimum time required is 7 seconds.

At time t == 4, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
At time t == 5, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: moveTime = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]

Output: 6

Explanation:

The minimum time required is 6 seconds.

At time t == 0, move from room (0, 0) to room (1, 0) in one second.
At time t == 1, move from room (1, 0) to room (1, 1) in two seconds.
At time t == 3, move from room (1, 1) to room (1, 2) in one second.
At time t == 4, move from room (1, 2) to room (1, 3) in two seconds.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: moveTime = [[0,1],[1,2]]

Output: 4
```
