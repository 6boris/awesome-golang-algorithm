# [3337.Total Characters in String After Transformations II][title]

## Description
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer `t` representing the number of **transformation** to perform, and an array `nums` of size 26. In one **transformation**, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:

- Replace `s[i]` with the **next** `nums[s[i] - 'a']` consecutive characters in the alphabet. For example, if `s[i] = 'a'` and `nums[0] = 3`, the character `'a'` transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in `"bcd"`.
- The transformation **wraps** around the alphabet if it exceeds `'z'`. For example, if `s[i] = 'y'` and `nums[24] = 3`, the character `'y'` transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in `"zab"`.

Return the length of the resulting string after **exactly** `t` transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]

Output: 7

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'b' as nums[0] == 1
'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
Second Transformation (t = 2):

'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'd' becomes 'e' as nums[3] == 1
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "azbk", t = 1, nums = [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 8

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'bc' as nums[0] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'b' becomes 'cd' as nums[1] == 2
'k' becomes 'lm' as nums[10] == 2
String after the first transformation: "bcabcdlm"
Final Length of the string: The string is "bcabcdlm", which has 8 characters.
```
