# [861.Score After Flipping Matrix][title]

## Description
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`.

A **move** consists of choosing any row or column and toggling each value in that row or column (i.e., changing all `0`'s to `1`'s, and all `1`'s to `0`'s).

Every row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the **score** of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible **score** after making any number of **moves** (including zero moves).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
Explanation: 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: 1
```
