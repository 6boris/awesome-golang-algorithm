# [811.Subdomain Visit Count][title]

## Description
A website domain `"discuss.leetcode.com"` consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have `"com"`, at the next level, we have `"leetcode.com"` and at the lowest level, `"discuss.leetcode.com"`. When we visit a domain like `"discuss.leetcode.com"`, we will also visit the parent domains `"leetcode.com"` and `"com"` implicitly.

A **count-paired domain** is a domain that has one of the two formats `"rep d1.d2.d3"` or `"rep d1.d2"` where `rep` is the number of visits to the domain and `d1.d2.d3` is the domain itself.

- For example, `"9001 discuss.leetcode.com"` is a **count-paired domain** that indicates that `discuss.leetcode.com` was visited `9001` times.

Given an array of **count-paired domains** `cpdomains`, return an array of the **count-paired domains** of each subdomain in the input. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cpdomains = ["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
Output: ["9001 leetcode.com","9001 discuss.leetcode.com","9001 com"]
Explanation: We only have one website domain: "discuss.leetcode.com".
As discussed above, the subdomain "leetcode.com" and "com" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cpdomains = ["900 google.mail.com", "50 yahoo.com", "1 intel.mail.com", "5 wiki.org"]
Output: ["901 mail.com","50 yahoo.com","900 google.mail.com","5 wiki.org","5 org","1 intel.mail.com","951 com"]
Explanation: We will visit "google.mail.com" 900 times, "yahoo.com" 50 times, "intel.mail.com" once and "wiki.org" 5 times.
For the subdomains, we will visit "mail.com" 900 + 1 = 901 times, "com" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and "org" 5 times.
```
