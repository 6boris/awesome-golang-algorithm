# [848.Shifting Letters][title]

## Description
You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an integer array `shifts` of the same length.

Call the `shift()` of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`).

- For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i + 1` letters of `s`, x times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of s by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaa", shifts = [1,2,3]
Output: "gfd"
```
