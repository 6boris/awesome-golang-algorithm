# [833.Find And Replace in String][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` that you must perform `k` replacement operations on. The replacement operations are given as three **0-indexed** parallel arrays, `indices`, `sources`, and `targets`, all of length `k`.

To complete the i<sup>th</sup> replacement operation:

1. Check if the **substring** `sources[i]` occurs at index `indices[i]` in the **original string** `s`.
2. If it does not occur, **do nothing**.
3. Otherwise if it does occur, **replace** that substring with `targets[i]`.

For example, if `s = "abcd"`, `indices[i] = 0`, `sources[i] = "ab"`, and `targets[i] = "eee"`, then the result of this replacement will be `"eeecd"`.

All replacement operations must occur **simultaneously**, meaning the replacement operations should not affect the indexing of each other. The testcases will be generated such that the replacements will **not overlap**.

- For example, a testcase with `s = "abc"`, `indices = [0, 1]`, and `sources = ["ab","bc"]` will not be generated because the `"ab"` and `"bc"` replacements overlap.

Return the **resulting string** after performing all replacement operations on `s`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**  

![1](./833-ex1.png)

```
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
Explanation:
"a" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"cd" occurs at index 2 in s, so we replace it with "ffff".
```

**Example 2:**  

![2](./833-ex2-1.png)

```
Input: s = "abcd", indices = [0, 2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeecd"
Explanation:
"ab" occurs at index 0 in s, so we replace it with "eee".
"ec" does not occur at index 2 in s, so we do nothing.
```
