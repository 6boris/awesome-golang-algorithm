# [844.Backspace String Compare][title]

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `'#'` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

```
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
```
