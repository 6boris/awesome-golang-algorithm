# [2780.Minimum Index of a Valid Split][title]

## Description
An element `x` of an integer array `arr` of length `m` is **dominant** if **more than half** the elements of `arr` have a value of `x`.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` with one **dominant** element.

You can split `nums` at an index `i` into two arrays `nums[0, ..., i]` and `nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1]`, but the split is only **valid** if:

- `0 <= i < n - 1`
- `nums[0, ..., i]`, and `nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1]` have the same dominant element.

Here, `nums[i, ..., j]` denotes the subarray of `nums` starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`, both ends being inclusive. Particularly, if `j < i` then `nums[i, ..., j]` denotes an empty subarray.

Return the **minimum** index of a *8valid split**. If no valid split exists, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can split the array at index 2 to obtain arrays [1,2,2] and [2]. 
In array [1,2,2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs twice in the array and 2 * 2 > 3. 
In array [2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs once in the array and 1 * 2 > 1.
Both [1,2,2] and [2] have the same dominant element as nums, so this is a valid split. 
It can be shown that index 2 is the minimum index of a valid split. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,1,1,1,7,1,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can split the array at index 4 to obtain arrays [2,1,3,1,1] and [1,7,1,2,1].
In array [2,1,3,1,1], element 1 is dominant since it occurs thrice in the array and 3 * 2 > 5.
In array [1,7,1,2,1], element 1 is dominant since it occurs thrice in the array and 3 * 2 > 5.
Both [2,1,3,1,1] and [1,7,1,2,1] have the same dominant element as nums, so this is a valid split.
It can be shown that index 4 is the minimum index of a valid split.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,7,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that there is no valid split.
```
