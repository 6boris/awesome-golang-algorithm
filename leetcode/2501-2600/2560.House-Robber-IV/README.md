# [2560.House Robber IV][title]

## Description

There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he **refuses to steal from adjacent homes**.

The **capability** of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the houses he robbed.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the `ith` house from the left has `nums[i]` dollars.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum** number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least k houses.

Return the **minimum** capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least k houses.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.
- Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.
Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4. Return max(nums[0], nums[4]) = 2.
```
