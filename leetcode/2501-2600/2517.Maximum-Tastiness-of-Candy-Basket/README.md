# [2517.Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket][title]

## Description
You are given an array of positive integers `price` where `price[i]` denotes the price of the `ith` candy and a positive integer `k`.

The store sells baskets of `k` **distinct** candies. The **tastiness** of a candy basket is the smallest absolute difference of the **prices** of any two candies in the basket.

Return the **maximum** tastiness of a candy basket.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: price = [13,5,1,8,21,2], k = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: Choose the candies with the prices [13,5,21].
The tastiness of the candy basket is: min(|13 - 5|, |13 - 21|, |5 - 21|) = min(8, 8, 16) = 8.
It can be proven that 8 is the maximum tastiness that can be achieved.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: price = [1,3,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Choose the candies with the prices [1,3].
The tastiness of the candy basket is: min(|1 - 3|) = min(2) = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum tastiness that can be achieved.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: price = [7,7,7,7], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: Choosing any two distinct candies from the candies we have will result in a tastiness of 0.
```
