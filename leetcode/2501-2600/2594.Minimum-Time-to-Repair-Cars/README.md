# [2594.Minimum Time to Repair Cars][title]

## Description
You are given an integer array `ranks` representing the **ranks** of some mechanics. ranksi is the rank of the `ith` mechanic. A mechanic with a rank `r` can repair n cars in `r * n^2` minutes.

You are also given an integer `cars` representing the total number of cars waiting in the garage to be repaired.

Return the **minimum** time taken to repair all the cars.

**Note**: All the mechanics can repair the cars simultaneously.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ranks = [4,2,3,1], cars = 10
Output: 16
Explanation: 
- The first mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 4 * 2 * 2 = 16 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair two cars. The time required is 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 minutes.
- The fourth mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ranks = [5,1,8], cars = 6
Output: 16
Explanation: 
- The first mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 5 * 1 * 1 = 5 minutes.
- The second mechanic will repair four cars. The time required is 1 * 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.
- The third mechanic will repair one car. The time required is 8 * 1 * 1 = 8 minutes.
It can be proved that the cars cannot be repaired in less than 16 minutes.
