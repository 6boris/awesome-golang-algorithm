# [2593.Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements][title]

## Description
You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

Starting with `score = 0`, apply the following algorithm:

- Choose the smallest integer of the array that is not marked. If there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest index.
- Add the value of the chosen integer to `score`.
- Mark **the chosen element and its two adjacent elements if they exist**.
- Repeat until all the array elements are marked.

Return the score you get after applying the above algorithm.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,4,5,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its left adjacent element: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 4 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
Our score is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,1,3,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, since there are two of them, we choose the left-most one, so we mark the one at index 0 and its right adjacent element: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
- 2 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
Our score is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.
```
