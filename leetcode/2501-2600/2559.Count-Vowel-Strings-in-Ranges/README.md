# [2559.Count Vowel Strings in Ranges][title]

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** array of strings `words` and a 2D array of integers `queries`.

Each query `queries[i] = [li, ri]` asks us to find the number of strings present in the range `li` to `ri` (both **inclusive**) of `words` that start and end with a vowel.

Return an array `ans` of size `queries.length`, where `ans[i]` is the answer to the `ith` query.

**Note** that the vowel letters are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["aba","bcb","ece","aa","e"], queries = [[0,2],[1,4],[1,1]]
Output: [2,3,0]
Explanation: The strings starting and ending with a vowel are "aba", "ece", "aa" and "e".
The answer to the query [0,2] is 2 (strings "aba" and "ece").
to query [1,4] is 3 (strings "ece", "aa", "e").
to query [1,1] is 0.
We return [2,3,0].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a","e","i"], queries = [[0,2],[0,1],[2,2]]
Output: [3,2,1]
Explanation: Every string satisfies the conditions, so we return [3,2,1].
```
