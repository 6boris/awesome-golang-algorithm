# [2523.Closest Prime Numbers in Range][title]

## Description
Given two positive integers `left` and `right`, find the two integers `num1` and `num2` such that:

- `left <= num1 < num2 <= right`.
- Both `num1` and `num2` are prime numbers.
- `num2 - num1` is the **minimum** amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.

Return the positive integer array `ans = [num1, num2]`. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the **smallest** `num1` value. If no such numbers exist, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: left = 10, right = 19
Output: [11,13]
Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: left = 4, right = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the conditions cannot be satisfied.
```
