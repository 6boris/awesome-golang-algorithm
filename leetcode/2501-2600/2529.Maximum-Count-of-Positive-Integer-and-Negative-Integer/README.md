# [2529.Maximum Count of Positive Integer and Negative Integer][title]

## Description
Given an array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return the maximum between the number of positive integers and the number of negative integers.

- In other words, if the number of positive integers in `nums` is `pos` and the number of negative integers is `neg`, then return the maximum of `pos` and `neg`.

**Note** that `0` is neither positive nor negative.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-2,-1,-1,1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 2 positive integers and 3 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [5,20,66,1314]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 positive integers and 0 negative integers. The maximum count among them is 4.
```
