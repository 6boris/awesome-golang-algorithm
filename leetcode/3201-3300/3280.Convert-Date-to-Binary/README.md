# [3280.Convert Date to Binary][title]

## Description
You are given a string `date` representing a Gregorian calendar date in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format.

`date` can be written in its binary representation obtained by converting year, month, and day to their binary representations without any leading zeroes and writing them down in `year-month-day` format.

Return the **binary** representation of `date`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: date = "2080-02-29"

Output: "100000100000-10-11101"

Explanation:

100000100000, 10, and 11101 are the binary representations of 2080, 02, and 29 respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: date = "1900-01-01"

Output: "11101101100-1-1"

Explanation:

11101101100, 1, and 1 are the binary representations of 1900, 1, and 1 respectively.
