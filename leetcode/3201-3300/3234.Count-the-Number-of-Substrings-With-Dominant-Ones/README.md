# [3234.Count the Number of Substrings With Dominant Ones][title]

## Description
You are given a binary string `s`.

Return the number of substrings with **dominant** ones.

A string has **dominant** ones if the number of ones in the string is **greater than or equal to** the **square** of the number of zeros in the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "00011"

Output: 5

Explanation:

The substrings with dominant ones are shown in the table below.

i	j	s[i..j]	Number of Zeros	Number of Ones
3	3	1	0	1
4	4	1	0	1
2	3	01	1	1
3	4	11	0	2
2	4	011	1	2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "101101"

Output: 16

Explanation:

The substrings with non-dominant ones are shown in the table below.

Since there are 21 substrings total and 5 of them have non-dominant ones, it follows that there are 16 substrings with dominant ones.

i	j	s[i..j]	Number of Zeros	Number of Ones
1	1	0	1	0
4	4	0	1	0
1	4	0110	2	2
0	4	10110	2	3
1	5	01101	2	3
```
