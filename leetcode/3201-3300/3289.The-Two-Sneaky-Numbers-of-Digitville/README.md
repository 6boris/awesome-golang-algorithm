# [3289.The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville][title]

## Description
In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called `nums` containing integers from `0` to `n - 1`. Each number was supposed to appear **exactly once** in the list, however, **two** mischievous numbers sneaked in an additional time, making the list longer than usual.

As the town detective, your task is to find these **two** sneaky numbers. Return an array of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to Digitville.

**Example 1:**

Explanation:

The numbers 0 and 1 each appear twice in the array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
