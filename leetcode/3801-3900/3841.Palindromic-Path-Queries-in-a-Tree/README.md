# [3841.Palindromic Path Queries in a Tree][title]

## Description
You are given an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled 0 to `n - 1`. This is represented by a 2D array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters, where `s[i]` represents the character assigned to node `i`.

You are also given a string array `queries`, where each `queries[i]` is either:

- `"update ui c"`: Change the character at node `ui` to `c`. Formally, update `s[ui] = c`.
- `"query ui vi"`: Determine whether the string formed by the characters on the **unique** path from `ui` to `vi` (inclusive) can be **rearranged** into a palindrome.

Return a boolean array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is `true` if the `jth` query of type `"query ui vi"` can be rearranged into a **palindrome**, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], s = "aac", queries = ["query 0 2","update 1 b","query 0 2"]

Output: [true,false]

Explanation:

"query 0 2": Path 0 → 1 → 2 gives "aac", which can be rearranged to form "aca", a palindrome. Thus, answer[0] = true.
"update 1 b": Update node 1 to 'b', now s = "abc".
"query 0 2": Path characters are "abc", which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, answer[1] = false.
Thus, answer = [true, false].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]], s = "abca", queries = ["query 1 2","update 0 b","query 2 3","update 3 a","query 1 3"]

Output: [false,false,true]

Explanation:

"query 1 2": Path 1 → 0 → 2 gives "bac", which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, answer[0] = false.
"update 0 b": Update node 0 to 'b', now s = "bbca".
"query 2 3": Path 2 → 0 → 3 gives "cba", which cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome. Thus, answer[1] = false.
"update 3 a": Update node 3 to 'a', s = "bbca".
"query 1 3": Path 1 → 0 → 3 gives "bba", which can be rearranged to form "bab", a palindrome. Thus, answer[2] = true.
Thus, answer = [false, false, true].
```
