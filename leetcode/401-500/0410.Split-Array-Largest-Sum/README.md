# [410.Split Array Largest Sum][title]

## Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, split `nums` into `k` non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of any subarray is **minimized**.

Return the minimized largest sum of the split.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
Output: 18
Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.
```
