# [437.Path Sum III][title]

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (i.e., traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).


**Example 1:**  
<!--![tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/pathsum3-1-tree.jpg)-->
![pathsum3-1](./pathsum3-1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: 3
```
