# [415.Add Strings][title]


## Description
Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```

__Example 3__

```
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```
