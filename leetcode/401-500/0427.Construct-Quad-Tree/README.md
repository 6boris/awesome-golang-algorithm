# [427.Construct Quad Tree][title]

## Description
Given a `n * n` matrix grid of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the `grid`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to **True** or **False** when `isLeaf` is **False**, and both are **accepted** in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

- `val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.
- `isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

```cpp
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.

If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.

Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

**Quad-Tree format**:

The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [`isLeaf`, `val`].

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as **1** in the list [`isLeaf`, `val`] and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as **0**.

**Example 1:**  

![example1](./grid1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.

**Example 2:**  

![example2](./e2mat.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.
The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.
The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.
Explanation is shown in the photo below:
