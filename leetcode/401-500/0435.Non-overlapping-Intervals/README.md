# [435.Non-overlapping Intervals][title]

## Description
Given an array of `intervals` intervals where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```
