# [451.Sort Characters By Frequency][title]

## Description
Given a string `s`, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency** of the characters. The **frequency** of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so both "cccaaa" and "aaaccc" are valid answers.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```
