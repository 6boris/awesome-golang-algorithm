# [3488.Closest Equal Element Queries][title]

## Description
You are given a **circular** array nums and an array `queries`.

For each query `i`, you have to find the following:

- The **minimum** distance between the element at index `queries[i]` and **any** other index `j` in the **circular** array, where `nums[j] == nums[queries[i]]`. If no such index exists, the answer for that query should be `-1`.

Return an array `answer` of the **same** size as `queries`, where `answer[i]` represents the result for query `i`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,1,4,1,3,2], queries = [0,3,5]

Output: [2,-1,3]

Explanation:

Query 0: The element at queries[0] = 0 is nums[0] = 1. The nearest index with the same value is 2, and the distance between them is 2.
Query 1: The element at queries[1] = 3 is nums[3] = 4. No other index contains 4, so the result is -1.
Query 2: The element at queries[2] = 5 is nums[5] = 3. The nearest index with the same value is 1, and the distance between them is 3 (following the circular path: 5 -> 6 -> 0 -> 1).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [0,1,2,3]

Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]

Explanation:

Each value in nums is unique, so no index shares the same value as the queried element. This results in -1 for all queries.
```
