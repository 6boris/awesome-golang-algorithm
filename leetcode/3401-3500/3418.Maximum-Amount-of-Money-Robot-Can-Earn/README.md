# [3418.Maximum Amount of Money Robot Can Earn][title]

## Description
You are given an `m x n` grid. A robot starts at the top-left corner of the grid (`0, 0`) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner (`m - 1, n - 1`). The robot can move either right or down at any point in time.

The grid contains a value `coins[i][j]` in each cell:

- If `coins[i][j] >= 0`, the robot gains that many coins.
- If `coins[i][j] < 0`, the robot encounters a robber, and the robber steals the **absolute** value of `coins[i][j]` coins.

The robot has a special ability to **neutralize robbers** in at most **2** cells on its path, preventing them from stealing coins in those cells.

**Note**: The robot's total coins can be negative.

Return the **maximum** profit the robot can gain on the route.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [[0,1,-1],[1,-2,3],[2,-3,4]]

Output: 8

Explanation:

An optimal path for maximum coins is:

Start at (0, 0) with 0 coins (total coins = 0).
Move to (0, 1), gaining 1 coin (total coins = 0 + 1 = 1).
Move to (1, 1), where there's a robber stealing 2 coins. The robot uses one neutralization here, avoiding the robbery (total coins = 1).
Move to (1, 2), gaining 3 coins (total coins = 1 + 3 = 4).
Move to (2, 2), gaining 4 coins (total coins = 4 + 4 = 8).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [[10,10,10],[10,10,10]]

Output: 40

Explanation:

An optimal path for maximum coins is:

Start at (0, 0) with 10 coins (total coins = 10).
Move to (0, 1), gaining 10 coins (total coins = 10 + 10 = 20).
Move to (0, 2), gaining another 10 coins (total coins = 20 + 10 = 30).
Move to (1, 2), gaining the final 10 coins (total coins = 30 + 10 = 40).
```
