# [3499.Maximize Active Section with Trade I][title]

## Description
You are given a binary string `s` of length `n`, where:

- `'1'` represents an **active** section.
- `'0'` represents an **inactive** section.

You can perform **at most one trade** to maximize the number of active sections in `s`. In a trade, you:

- Convert a contiguous block of `'1'`s that is surrounded by `'0'`s to all `'0'`s.
- Afterward, convert a contiguous block of `'0'`s that is surrounded by `'1'`s to all `'1'`s.

Return the **maximum** number of active sections in `s` after making the optimal trade.

**Note**: Treat s as if it is **augmented** with a `'1'` at both ends, forming `t = '1' + s + '1'`. The augmented `'1'`s **do not** contribute to the final count.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "01"

Output: 1

Explanation:

Because there is no block of '1's surrounded by '0's, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "0100"

Output: 4

Explanation:

String "0100" → Augmented to "101001".
Choose "0100", convert "101001" → "100001" → "111111".
The final string without augmentation is "1111". The maximum number of active sections is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "1000100"

Output: 7

Explanation:

String "1000100" → Augmented to "110001001".
Choose "000100", convert "110001001" → "110000001" → "111111111".
The final string without augmentation is "1111111". The maximum number of active sections is 7.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "01010"

Output: 4

Explanation:

String "01010" → Augmented to "1010101".
Choose "010", convert "1010101" → "1000101" → "1111101".
The final string without augmentation is "11110". The maximum number of active sections is 4.
```
