# [3405.Count the Number of Arrays with K Matching Adjacent Elements][title]

## Description

You are given three integers `n`, `m`, `k`. A **good array** `arr` of size `n` is defined as follows:

- Each element in `arr` is in the **inclusive** range `[1, m]`.
- Exactly `k` indices `i` (where `1 <= i < n`) satisfy the condition `arr[i - 1] == arr[i]`.

Return the number of **good arrays** that can be formed.

Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, m = 2, k = 1

Output: 4

Explanation:

There are 4 good arrays. They are [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 1].
Hence, the answer is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, m = 2, k = 2

Output: 6

Explanation:

The good arrays are [1, 1, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1, 1] and [2, 2, 2, 1].
Hence, the answer is 6.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, m = 2, k = 0

Output: 2

Explanation:

The good arrays are [1, 2, 1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]. Hence, the answer is 2.
```
