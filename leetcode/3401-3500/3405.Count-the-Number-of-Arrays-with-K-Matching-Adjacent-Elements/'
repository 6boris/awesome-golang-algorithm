# [3405.Count the Number of Arrays with K Matching Adjacent Elements][title]

## Description

You are given three integers `n`, `m`, `k`. A **good array** arr of size n is defined as follows:

Each element in arr is in the inclusive range [1, m].
Exactly k indices i (where 1 <= i < n) satisfy the condition arr[i - 1] == arr[i].
Return the number of good arrays that can be formed.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```
