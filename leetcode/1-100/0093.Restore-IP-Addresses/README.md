# [93. Restore IP Addresses][title]

## Description
A **valid IP address** consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between `0` and `255` (**inclusive**) and cannot have leading zeros.

- For example, `"0.1.2.201"` and `"192.168.1.1"` are **valid** IP addresses, but `"0.011.255.245"`, `"192.168.1.312"` and `"192.168@1.1"` are **invalid** IP addresses.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into `s`. You are **not** allowed to reorder or remove any digits in `s`. You may return the valid IP addresses in **any** order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "0000"
Output: ["0.0.0.0"]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "101023"
Output: ["1.0.10.23","1.0.102.3","10.1.0.23","10.10.2.3","101.0.2.3"]
```
