# [3567.Minimum Absolute Difference in Sliding Submatrix][title]

## Description
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`.

For every contiguous `k x k` **submatrix** of `grid`, compute the **minimum absolute** difference between any two **distinct** values within that **submatrix**.

Return a 2D array `ans` of size `(m - k + 1) x (n - k + 1)`, where `ans[i][j]` is the minimum absolute difference in the submatrix whose top-left corner is `(i, j)` in `grid`.

**Note**: If all elements in the submatrix have the same value, the answer will be 0.

A submatrix `(x1, y1, x2, y2)` is a matrix that is formed by choosing all cells `matrix[x][y]` where `x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,8],[3,-2]], k = 2

Output: [[2]]

Explanation:

There is only one possible k x k submatrix: [[1, 8], [3, -2]].
Distinct values in the submatrix are [1, 8, 3, -2].
The minimum absolute difference in the submatrix is |1 - 3| = 2. Thus, the answer is [[2]].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[3,-1]], k = 1

Output: [[0,0]]

Explanation:

Both k x k submatrix has only one distinct element.
Thus, the answer is [[0, 0]].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,-2,3],[2,3,5]], k = 2

Output: [[1,2]]

Explanation:

There are two possible k × k submatrix:
Starting at (0, 0): [[1, -2], [2, 3]].
Distinct values in the submatrix are [1, -2, 2, 3].
The minimum absolute difference in the submatrix is |1 - 2| = 1.
Starting at (0, 1): [[-2, 3], [3, 5]].
Distinct values in the submatrix are [-2, 3, 5].
The minimum absolute difference in the submatrix is |3 - 5| = 2.
Thus, the answer is [[1, 2]].
```
