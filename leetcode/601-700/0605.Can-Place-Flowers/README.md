## Description

Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False
```
